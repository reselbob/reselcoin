# reselcoin

## [`UNDER CONSTRUCTION`]

A project written in TypeScript that demonstrates the essential concepts and techniques needed to create a distributed ledger that uses a fictitious crypto-coin named `reselcoin` as currency.

This project builds on the work that was first released as a [JavaScript application](https://github.com/Savjee/SavjeeCoin) by [Xavier Decuyper](https://www.savjee.be/).

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/reselbob/reselcoin.git
```

```bash
cd reselcoin
```

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the tests

The tests provide insights into creating a blockchain, running an Initial Coin Offering against the blockchain and transferring coins from the `reselcoin` Treasury's wallet to the wallet of a user named `Seeder`.

To run the tests:

```bash
npm run test
```
