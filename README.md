# reselcoin

## [`UNDER CONSTRUCTION`]

A project written in TypeScript that demonstrates the essential concepts and techniques needed to create a distributed ledger that uses a fictitious crypto-coin named `reselcoin` as currency.

This project builds on the work that was first released as a [JavaScript application](https://github.com/Savjee/SavjeeCoin) by [Xavier Decuyper](https://www.savjee.be/).
